      caused a large ripple, you've been thrown into the trunk. You must reach the

      The rest hold a single note, you\u2019re not the only to find themselves here.
      Once again, I can offer you a gift, I hope you can trust me now. "

    _contents: "Just how did the voice get stuck here. I\u2019ve never heard of this
      happening before. The great tree is contained by the rules of this realm. Nothing
      goes against these rules, its impossible. Once you go into a branch you appear
      in the dimension it connects to. It just doesn\u2019t make sense."

    _title: The sapling
    _contents: "Surely the voice wasn\u2019t talking about the sapling from the stories,
      he can\u2019t be. It\u2019s just a stupid story that my parents told me to
      keep me well behaved, I use the same story on my kids now. I believed it till
      I grew older but it\u2019s simply a badly written ghost story. In short if
      you missed behaved as a kid the sapling would eat you and would trap you in
      its branches for eternity. The sapling doesn\u2019t exist, it can\u2019t \u2026"
